# Snake

## Description
The program is a 2D Java version of the classic video game, Snake. The player is able to control the snake through the cursor keys, and the objective of the game
is to eat as many apples. When eating an apple the snake will grow, and the snake will have to avoid both its own body and the walls.
When the game is finished, the "Game Over" message is displayed in the middle of the board.
